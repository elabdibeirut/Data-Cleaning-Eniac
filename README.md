Due to the ongoing debate about the benefit of promotional prices at Eniac, we'd been provided with internal data, which had been corrupted.
To answer the business question, we had to clean the data first.
Our work consisted of: 
      1. Exploring the Data
      2. Cleaning the Data with Pandas
      3. Data Quality
      4. Come Up with Products Categorising System
      5. Analyse the discounts
      6. Data Visualisation using seaborn & matplotlib
